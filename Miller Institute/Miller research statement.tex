David Eisenbud
Miller Professor 2024-2025
Home Institution: UC Berkeley
E-mail: de@berkeley.edu

David Eisenbud received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Chicago, where he was a student of Saunders MacLane and Christopher Robson. He taught for many years at Brandeis University near Boston, but moved to Berkeley in 1997, to become Professor of Mathematics at U.C. Berkeley and Director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, in which position he served a total of 19 years. Eisenbud specializes in commutative algebra (especially free resolutions) and algebraic geometry (especially algebraic curves, aka Riemann surfaces). He is also interested in computer algebra (which he has used to provide examples leading to some of his most interesting theorems) and the intertwined history of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Eisenbud's main project for his Miller Professorship year is to study some newly-discovered aspects of infinite free resolutions.
